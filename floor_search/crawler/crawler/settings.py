# Note from project creator:
# If you are new to framework, like i was during making this project, here is a tip.
# This setting disable exctracting data from some websites, like directly from google
# search engine responses
# Look up your spiders logs for clues on why sometimes it extracts no data.
# Setting this to False will open your spiders for some more possibilities
# Framework automatically downloads robots.txt file if not present in directory
